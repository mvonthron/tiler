Tiler - Window tiling utility for X11
=====================================

Tiler is a lightweight tiling utility for X Window Managers. It uses keyboard
shortcuts to organize windows on your desktop on demand. This provides a 
very convenient way of moving/resizing windows, for instance by showing
side-by-side two windows. This is especially useful for large screens.

An admitted goal is to provide a comparable tool as the (very great) 
WinSplit Revolution available on Windows.



Examples
--------

The default configuration file provides keybindings using the keypad
of full sized keyboards.

CTRL+ALT+3 : resize and move active window to fit the bottom-right quadrant
  of the screen.

CTRL+ALT+8 : resize and move active window to fit the upper half of the screen.

CTRL+ALT+Enter : organize the two most recently used windows side by side.

CTRL+ALT+5 : organize the four most recently used windows on a grid.

  
Requirements
------------

Your window manager is expected to be EWMH compliant and implementing the whole
window manager standard (http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/latest/). 
KWin (KDE) and Metacity (Gnome) are ok with that, some workarounds have been
written for the use with Compiz.

The program is written in C with very few dependencies, you will
only need the following (and their headers):
  - libc
  - libm
  - libx11


Installation
------------

$ make
# make install


Things & stuff
--------------

Please note that this program is in early development. 

  * Only single screen display is supported at the moment (but this is one
      of the top priorities)
  * Layout may sometimes look weird because of window constraints such as 
      "resizing step" (mostly in terminals) or minimum window size. Theses 
      may not allow to fit the desired window geometry and especially affects 
      small resolutions
